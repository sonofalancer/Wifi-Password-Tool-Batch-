# Wifi-Password-Tool-Batch

This batch file can find the password of a Wifi you have connected to before.
This will create a .TXT file in your \downloads folder called "Wifi-Passwords.txt" where it will store all the passwords.
If used multiple times, it will add all the passwords to "Wifi-Passwords.txt" and there will be the name of the Wifi next to it.

Should give a response to every possible error that could occur.
